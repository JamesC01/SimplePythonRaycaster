# SimplePythonRaycaster
A simple raycaster implemented in Python using PyGame. The map is randomly generated using simplex noise.

## Controls
* __Up__ and __down__ move you forward and back
* __Left__ and __right__ rotate your view
* __P__ toggles the 2d preview
* __Space__ deletes the cells in front of you (use this if you spawn inside of a cell)
